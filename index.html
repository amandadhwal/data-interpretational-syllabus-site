                          <p>As the name suggests, Data Interpretation is all about reading and understanding the given data set. Data can be provided in various formats such as bar, table, line graph, pie chart, etc. We all have studied mean and median in high school and have a basic knowledge of how to read bars and charts. In case of MBA entrance exams, the challenge lies in interpreting the data accurately in just about one minute. Let’s look at it in detail.</p>

                       <br><B> Bar Graph</B>: A bar graph is pictorial representation of two related form of data. One needs to read one set of date in relation to the other set of data. A bar graph is based on two axis: X-axis and Y-axis and can be horizontal or vertical. In a horizontal bar graph, Y-axis shows the data categories and X-axis shows the scale. In vertical bar graph, it is vice versa.
                        
                       <br><B>Tables</B>: In Tables, the data is presented in the form of rows and columns. The questions based on tables generally requires candidates to read and interpret the data and find the right answer. 
                        
                       <br><B>Line Graph</B>: A line graph is a representation of data/activity over a certain period of time. In this form of data presentation, rise/fall/change is represented on a line over x-axis and Y-axis. In most MBA entrance exams, various DI questions are based on line graphs.
                        
                       <br><B>Pie Chart</B>: Data in pie charts are represented circular shaped graphs divided into sectors to represent numerical proportions of the sub-set. Reading a pie chart is often simpler than other form of pictorial representation as it is easier to visually identify which section takes up more space in the pie.
                        
                       <br><b>Caselets</b>: A set of paragraphs that include numerical data in them which needs to be put in a structure to be understood. These could be counting based, calculation based, logic based or structure based. Given below are some examples for Caselets:
                        
                       <br> <B>Counting based sets</B>: A set of data for candidates to count the instances which meets the question’s needs. For example: How many states have male employment rate more than 70 per cent and female employment rate less than 65 per cent?

                       <br> <b>Calculation based sets</b>: These sets have data in the form of percentage increase/decrease. For example: In which year ITC reported highest increase in revenue, in the last 10 years.
                        Logic Based Sets: These sets have data presented in range or with condition where exact numbers are hard to decipher. For <br><b>example</b>: How many of the gym members of the range 25 to 35 years would be above 30 years if average age of the members of this age group Is 42?
                        Structure Based: These sets are rarely asked as the data presented is layered and they are time consuming. For example: Sets based on goals of various teams in a tournament.<Br><br>
